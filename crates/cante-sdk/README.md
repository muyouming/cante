# cante-sdk

Rust SDK for Cante.

A `Client` is one connection to a Cante host. It sends `Op`s and receives
`EventMsg`s; which session it drives is decided by the ops sent over it, never
by how it was opened.

```rust
let client = cante_sdk::connect("stdio".parse()?, ConnectOptions::default()).await?;
```

An `Endpoint` names where a host is reachable, never a session:

| Endpoint | The client | Host lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stdio` | spawns `cante serve --stdio` as its own child | the connection's |
| `unix:<path>` | dials the socket file of an `cante serve --sock` host | someone else's |
| `ws://<addr>` | dials a WebSocket server (not yet connectable) | someone else's |

A process that hosts sessions itself obtains the same `Client` type from its
host directly; the in-process channel carries the same wire types the remote
codecs serialize.

[`examples/mini-tui`](../../examples/mini-tui) is a chat TUI in one file:
it connects over `stdio`, streams the reply, and answers tool approvals
with `y`/`n`. It needs a working `cante` on `PATH`; model and provider come
from your settings.

```sh
cd examples/mini-tui && cargo run
```

The `claude` module is unrelated: it drives Claude Code as a child process.
