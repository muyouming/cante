# Curated

A shared space for the team and community to exchange reusable Cante pieces: settings profiles, skills, and whatever proves useful enough to pass around.

The layout mirrors `~/.cante/`, so installing a piece is a straight copy: profiles (`<name>.settings.json`) sit at the top level, skills under `skills/`.

## Profiles

Settings profiles for `cante --profile <name>`. Copy one to `~/.cante/`:

```sh
cp pi.settings.json ~/.cante/
cante --profile pi
```

Profiles are whole-file replacements: values a profile omits fall back to Cante defaults, not to your `settings.json`. Explicit CLI flags still override the profile. See the [preferences docs](https://docs.antigma.ai/configuration/preference#named-profiles).

### pi

A pi-style agent (requires v0.preview.73+): four tools — Read, Write, Edit, Bash — and a concise replacement system prompt. Everything else routes through Bash:

- `rg` for file search (falling back to `grep`/`find`)
- `cante -p "<task>"` for one-shot subagents, `tmux` for persistent interactive agents (cante, claude, codex)
- small programs (`curl`, python, jq, sed/awk) for web fetch, web search, and large-scale edits

Skills, auto-memory, tips, and ambient predictions are off; the short prompt keeps tool descriptions compact. Sessions still save, so `/resume` works. No MCP servers, since the profile defines none.

The prompt's readable source is `pi.system-prompt.md` — JSON strings can't hold real newlines, so the `system_prompt` field is generated from it. Edit the markdown, then regenerate:

```sh
jq --rawfile prompt pi.system-prompt.md \
  '.system_prompt = ($prompt | rtrimstr("\n"))' \
  pi.settings.json > tmp && mv tmp pi.settings.json
```

### plan

A planning profile: the agent researches the codebase and delivers an implementation plan, but cannot edit. Write and Edit are absent from the tool set, so file changes are impossible, and an appended prompt keeps the model in planning posture. Permission mode is `strict`: known-safe read-only shell commands (`git log`, `git diff`, `rg`, and pipelines of vetted programs) run without prompts, while anything mutating asks. WebFetch and WebSearch are allowed by rule so research flows uninterrupted.

Plan under the profile, then execute without it — resuming a session restores the default tool set:

```sh
cante --profile plan       # produce the plan
cante                      # then /resume to execute with full tools
```

Headless runs imply yolo mode, which skips permission rules including the Bash ask; add `--exclude-tools Bash` for unattended planning. The profile omits `model` and `provider`, so it uses your default credentials. Pin a heavier model or effort by adding those fields to your copy.

## Skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) folders, each with a `SKILL.md`. Copy a folder into `~/.cante/skills/` for all projects, or `.cante/skills/` for one project. See the [skills docs](https://docs.antigma.ai/extend/skills).

## Contributing

Open a PR that adds your profile or skill where it would live in `~/.cante/`. Include a line or two on what it does and when to reach for it: in the skill's `description` frontmatter, or a short section in this README for a profile. New categories are welcome; add a folder and explain it here.

Strip anything personal before submitting: API keys, tokens, absolute paths, private URLs.
